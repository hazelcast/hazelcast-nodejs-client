The metrics binary compatibility file is autogenerated using the following file from Hazelcast repository.

https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/master/hazelcast/src/test/java/com/hazelcast/internal/metrics/impl/MetricsCompatibilityFileGenerator.java

For simplicity purposes, a single version of the metrics binary format is
currently assumed by the test suite. However, if a newer version appears
in future, please follow the same approach as with
`*-serialization.compatibility.binary` files.

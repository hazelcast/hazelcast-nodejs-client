# JAAS Code Sample

This code sample demonstrates how to assign different permission policies for different user groups with the
Hazelcast's JAAS based security features.
Security features used in this code sample requires **Hazelcast Enterprise** edition.

---

Users within the `adminGroup` have create, destroy, read and put permissions over the `importantAdminMap`.

Users within the `readerGroup` have just create and read permissions over the `importantReaderMap`.

To test the code sample,

* Make sure [hazelcast.xml](hazelcast-member/src/main/resources/hazelcast.xml) is in your class path.

* Start the Hazelcast member with [Bootstrap.java](hazelcast-member/src/main/java/com/company/Bootstrap.java).
If you are unsure about how to do that, see [the notes on starting `Bootstrap.java`](hazelcast-member/README.md).

* Run the [admin_client.js](admin_client.js) with the command `node admin_client.js` to see what can the users within
the `adminGroup` do.

* Run the [reader_client.js](reader_client.js) with the command `node reader_client.js` to see what can the users
within the `readerGroup` do.

You should see an output similar to below for the `admin_client.js`.

```text
Admin client connected
Admin can create a map
Admin can read from map: null
Admin can put to map
Value for the "anotherKey" is anotherValue
```

And, for the `reader_client.js` you should see an output similar to below.

```text
Reader client connected
Reader can create a map
Reader can read from map: null
Reader cannot put to map. Reason: Error: Class name: java.security.AccessControlException ,
Message: Permission ("com.hazelcast.security.permission.MapPermission" "importantReaderMap" "put") denied!
```

/**
 * PN (Positive-Negative) CRDT counter.
 *
 * The counter supports adding and subtracting values as well as
 * retrieving the current counter value.
 * The counter guarantees that whenever two nodes have received the
 * same set of updates, possibly in a different order, their state is
 * identical, and any conflicting updates are merged automatically.
 * If no new updates are made to the shared state, all nodes that can
 * communicate will eventually have the same data.
 *
 * The invocation is remote. This may lead to indeterminate state -
 * the update may be applied, but the response has not been received.
 * In this case, the caller will be notified with a `TargetDisconnectedError`
 *
 * The read and write methods provide monotonic read and RYW (read-your-write)
 * guarantees. These guarantees are session guarantees which means that if
 * no replica with the previously observed state is reachable, the session
 * guarantees are lost, and the method invocation will throw a
 * `ConsistencyLostError`. This does not mean
 * that an update is lost. All the updates are part of some replica and
 * will be eventually reflected in the state of all other replicas. This
 * error just means that you cannot observe your own writes because
 * all replicas that contain your updates are currently unreachable.
 * After you have received a `ConsistencyLostError`, you can either
 * wait for a sufficiently up-to-date replica to become reachable in which
 * case the session can be continued, or you can reset the session by calling
 * the `reset()` method. If you have called the `reset()` method,
 * a new session is started with the next invocation to a CRDT replica.
 *
 * <b>NOTE:</b>
 * The CRDT state is kept entirely on non-lite (data) members. If there
 * aren't any and the methods here are invoked, they will
 * fail with a `NoDataMemberInClusterError`.

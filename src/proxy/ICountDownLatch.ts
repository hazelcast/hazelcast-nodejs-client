/**
 * A distributed, concurrent countdown latch data structure.
 *
 * ICountDownLatch is a cluster-wide synchronization aid
 * that allows one or more callers to wait until a set of operations being
 * performed in other callers completes.
 *
 * ICountDownLatch count can be reset using `trySetCount()` method after
 * a countdown has finished but not during an active count. This allows
 * the same latch instance to be reused.
 *
 * There is no `await()` method to do an unbound wait since this is undesirable
 * in a distributed application: for example, a cluster can split, or the master
 * and replicas could all die. In most cases, it is best to configure
 * an explicit timeout, so you have the ability to deal with these situations.
 *
 * All of the API methods in the ICountDownLatch offer the exactly-once
 * execution semantics. For instance, even if a `countDown()` call is
 * internally retried because of crashed Hazelcast member, the counter
 * value is decremented only once.

/**
 * A linearizable, distributed lock.
 *
 * FencedLock is CP with respect to the CAP principle. It works on top
 * of the Raft consensus algorithm. It offers linearizability during crash-stop
 * failures and network partitions. If a network partition occurs, it remains
 * available on at most one side of the partition.
 *
 * FencedLock works on top of CP sessions. Please refer to Hazelcast CP Session
 * documentation section for more information.
 *
 * **Important note:** FencedLock is non-reentrant. Once a caller acquires
 * the lock, it can not acquire the lock reentrantly. So, the next acquire
 * attempt made within the same chain of async calls will lead to a dead lock.

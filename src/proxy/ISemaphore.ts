/**
 * A linearizable, distributed semaphore.
 *
 * ISemaphore works on top of the Raft consensus algorithm. It offers
 * linearizability during crash failures and network partitions. It is CP with
 * respect to the CAP principle. If a network partition occurs, it remains
 * available on at most one side of the partition.
 *
 * ISemaphore is a cluster-wide counting semaphore. Conceptually, it maintains
 * a set of permits. Each `acquire()` waits if necessary until a permit
 * is available, and then takes it. Dually, each `release()` adds a
 * permit, potentially releasing a waiting acquirer. However, no actual permit
 * objects are used; the semaphore just keeps a count of the number available
 * and acts accordingly.
 *
 * This data structure also provides convenience methods to work
 * with multiple permits at once. Beware of the increased risk of
 * indefinite postponement when using the multiple-permit acquire. If permits
 * are released one by one, a caller waiting for one permit will acquire
 * it before a caller waiting for multiple permits regardless of the call
 * order.
 *
 * Correct usage of a semaphore is established by programming convention
 * in the application.
 *
 * ISemaphore has two variations:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * The default implementation is session-aware. In this one, when a caller
 * makes its very first `acquire()` call, it starts a new CP session with
 * the underlying CP group. Then, liveliness of the caller is tracked via
 * this CP session. When the caller fails, permits acquired by this caller
 * are automatically and safely released. However, the session-aware version
 * comes with a limitation, that is, a Hazelcast client cannot release permits
 * before acquiring them first. In other words, a client can release only
 * the permits it has acquired earlier.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * The second implementation is sessionless. This one does not perform
 * auto-cleanup of acquired permits on failures. Acquired permits are not
 * bound to callers and permits can be released without acquiring first.
 * However, you need to handle failed permit owners on your own. If a Hazelcast
 * server or a client fails while holding some permits, they will not be
 * automatically released. You can use the sessionless CP ISemaphore
 * implementation by enabling JDK compatibility `jdk-compatible` server-side
 * setting. Refer to Semaphore configuration documentation for more details.
 * </li>
 * </ul>

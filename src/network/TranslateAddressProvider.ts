/**
 * Determines if the client should use an internal or public member address.
 * The public IP enabled property acts as a tri-state boolean. When set to
 * `true`, it makes the client to use public addresses. Setting it to `false`
 * makes the client to use internal addresses.
 *
 * If the property is not defined, this class tries to automatically detect
 * what to do. To do so, it executes the following steps:
 * 1. Check if internal member address is the same as defined in the client
 *    configuration (if it's the same, it means we can access members via their
 *    internal addresses, so no need to use public addresses); if not then
 * 2. Check if every member is reachable via public address but not reachable
 *    via internal address (for the performance reason, only 3 members are
 *    checked).
